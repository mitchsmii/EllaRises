            <h2>"Ella Rises showed me that my dreams weren't too big."</h2>
            <p>When Maria joined Ella Rises as a shy sophomore, she never imagined she'd be speaking at her high school graduation three years later. Through mentorship and our Leadership Academy, she discovered her voice—and learned how to use it.</p>
            <p>Today, Maria is a junior at State University studying communications, and she volunteers as a mentor for the next generation of Ella Rises girls.</p>
